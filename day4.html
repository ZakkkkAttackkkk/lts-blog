            <p> This morning, I was really late. I got to the bus from UPLB going to Cubao at around 5am, and ended up falling asleep right there and then. I was expecting to already be at Megamall before 7, but to my surprise when I woke up from my short nap at around 6:15 I was only at Alabang. The traffic situation started to really worry me. </p>
            <p> The heavy traffic made me get to UP only at 8:15, but I couldn't go straight to KNL already since I needed to get my teaching materials at the dorm and even had to print more lessons at the Shopping Center. And because of all this, I only got to class at 10:00. By that time I was already rushing to find Art Dave, but he apparently wasn't there. So, asking Teacher Sharey what to do, I ended up having a team teach with Roben Delos Reyes and his student Patrick. It was great, I thought, but they were on their last exercise already by the time I approached them. </p>
            <p> When they finished, I was looking for other students to help, but they all seemed to be almost done by then, so I left early (around 11:00) to finish other errand I had back on campus. When I got back inside UP, I realized what other stuff I possibly could've done, and so I regretted going back early so much. But I guess I could just wait and hope for the next time I could meet with Art Dave. </p>
