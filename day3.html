            <p> As usual, I was unprepared having gone from Laguna that same morning. But I could tell you there was progress achieved! </p>
            <p> We got to finish the previous exercise -- that, being letter writing -- and continued with the rest of thte preassessment. Afterwards, I couldn't help but notice how much difficulty he was having with reading pure text (aside from already being obviously too lazy to read). This surprises me given that he <i> has </i> told me about his fondness of reading comics. But maybe it's just the fact that he's being told to read something he's not that interested in. Or he might just not want to read something that is purely text and no pictures, which he shows a lot of interest for when reading "Ang Pamilya Ismid" and the other picture stories. </p>
            <p> At the end, Art Dave asked me if I could bring more books and even a toy (some toy dinosaur, if I recall correctly, "yung nabibili sa palengke"). Maybe he just finds fun in picture stories and stuff. But I do hold on to my observation of him being really distracted. That or that he just has that hard a time comprehending stories (he makes up a lot of facts when asked about a story we read together). It's going to be tough teaching this kid, but I could see how much fun we're gonna be having together. :D </p>
