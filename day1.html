            <p> Before we get to our journey with the grade schoolers, we got to look around Krus na Ligas Elementary School to get a feel of the place. We were familiarized with the route and the preparations needed for the sessions. I, however, arrived just a couple of minutes before the rented jeep left for the school so I didn't get to hear any of the reminders in the theater, where we waited. </p>
            <p> When we got there, Teacher Sharee told us a few more things to remember before proceeding. When we got in, we only walked around the first floor. By then I was already thinking of my teaching sessions. It was just sad that we weren't going to meet the kids yet, but at least my first session was going to start with me unprepared. But as I went back on campus early, I was already looking forward to meeting the kid I would be sitting with for the rest of the semester. :D </p>
