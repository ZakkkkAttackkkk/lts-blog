        	<blockquote> How did you feel when you learned that the program will no longer continue in the KNL Elementary School? </blockquote>
            <p> It really saddened me that we weren't to continue with teaching the students already assigned to us, because it made me feel like I let my student down not being able to finish the program (and not even getting to a single lesson!). But it did make me happy even just a little bit that we were to continue the program but with a different format and with different students, because it made me feel like I could still redeem myself with the new student to be assigned to me. </p>
        	<blockquote> Given this constraint, how were you able to contribute to the lives of the few students who joined the reading program? </blockquote>
            <p> I, together with my co-teacher, was able to help our new student review letters and somewhat understand letters on a new level. It also made us feel like we were special and that we were wanted, given that our student was very eager to learn evry meeting and was even early to every Monday session. </p>
        	<blockquote> Did you learn anything that surprised you after completing your program? </blockquote>
            <p> I learned that I had the potential to be a great teacher, and it made me feel confident given that I have plans of going into the academe after I graduate from my BS degree. It made me feel like I had some purpose, and it really helped my lift my self-esteem since I've been having a lot more existential crises and more frequent depressive states up until recently. </p>
