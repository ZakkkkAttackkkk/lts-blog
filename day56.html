            <p> The next two meetings, we weren't able to get back to KNL and have more sessions, since the students were having their final exams and were really busy with a lot of stuff. Thus, we were to have our FGD, when some of my classmates and I shared a lot of insights and got to talk about the problems we were having with the school. </p>
            <p> It was only after that that, when Teacher Sharey gave us the bad news about KNL Elementary School's decision, I realized I wasn't going to ever meet with Art Dave for LTS again. I regretted not having taught him properly and letting his distractions get in the way, since we were only able to accomplish the preassessment and not even get to Lesson 1. Though it was also very disappointing for them to have not let us proceed with the teachings. It was really saddening for me. But I guess I'd just have to wait and see whatever else there is for us to do for the rest of the semester. </p>
