            <p> Finally, it was the day I was waiting for. My first session with a student! I was very much eager to start the day and find out who would be my student. Although I was pretty guilty of not being able to prepare materials ahead of time, I was ready to have a talk with the lucky kid. And I guess could say, Art Dave <i> was </i> lucky. </p>
            <p> His name was Art Dave Visorio. He and I talked a bit at the start. Although shy at first, I could tell he was ready to learn and bond with me through the lessons. As I was unprepared as mentioned, I made flash cards on site using extra index cards I had in my bag. During that time, I got to know him a little bit, which is good for starters. I, being the older one, introduced myself and then asked him questions about himself. He told me he wants to be a ship captain and wants a big ship when he grows up. Big dreams this kid has, if you ask me. And so we proceeded with the preassessment. </p>
            <p> He seems very much distracted with a lot of things, and being the seemingly shy kid with a surprisingly large amount of stories to tell, he ends up telling me a lot of things every now and then. It was really hard for me to calm him down and to continue with the lessons. But as they all say, the show must go on. </p>
            <p> He did, however, start raising points about some struggles in his life. It did seem like he was asking for help initially, but later on it started looking like he just wanted to tell random stories. He told me about how he was being bullied and how certain then-existing bruises and wounds came to be. He also mentioned his mom having his dad arrested for some reason, and even said that his dad had some other woman. It was a lot for me to take in, given that I really didn't see all those stories coming. </p>
            <p> In the end, we stopped halfway through the preassessment (even if others already seem to have finished theirs), but it was a good start. So far, he shows that he can recognize letters, but can't seem to remember certain ones and can't quite distinguish uppercase with lowercase. He just writes bigger when told to write "malaking titik/letra/letters". </p>
            <p> Rough start, I might say. but I was sure this would be a great ride. </p>
